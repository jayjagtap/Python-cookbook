1. Processing large files: If you need to process a large file, reading the file line by line and processing it one line at a time can be much more memory efficient than reading the entire file into memory at once.
Here's an example of a generator function that reads a file line by line:

```
def read_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            yield line

for line in read_file('large_file.txt'):
    process_line(line)

```

2. Infinite sequence: If you need to generate an infinite sequence, such as a sequence of random numbers, you can use a generator function to generate the sequence one element at a time, without having to store the entire sequence in memory. Here's an example of a generator function that generates an infinite sequence of random numbers:

```
import random

def random_generator():
    while True:
        yield random.random()

for i in random_generator():
    print(i)

```

3. Lazy evaluation: If you have a situation where you only need to perform an operation on certain elements of a sequence, you can use a generator function to perform lazy evaluation. Here's an example of a generator function that filters a sequence based on a certain condition:

```
def filter_generator(iterable, condition):
    for item in iterable:
        if condition(item):
            yield item

for i in filter_generator(range(10), lambda x: x % 2 == 0):
    print(i)

```

4. Data pipeline: You can use generator functions in combination with other Python features such as list comprehension and the itertools library to create powerful and expressive data processing pipelines. Here is an example where we use generator expression to filter and map the sequence of numbers

```
gen = (i**2 for i in range(10) if i % 2 == 0)
for i in gen:
    print(i)

```

In all of these examples, the use of generator functions with yield statement allows you to iterate over the elements one at a time, which can be more memory efficient and allows you to perform lazy evaluation.

It's worth noting that generators are not always the best choice, depending on the problem you're trying to solve, other solutions such as list comprehension or other data structures may be more appropriate. However, generator functions can be a powerful tool in your toolbox for creating efficient and expressive data processing pipelines.
